# JavaScript Exercises for Practicing Conditions and Loops (Primitive Types)

## Exercise 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
Write a JavaScript program that prompts the user for a number and then determines if it's even or odd. Display the result in the console.

## Exercise 2: Sum of Numbers
Write a program that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to a user-defined number using a loop.

## Exercise 3: FizzBuzz
Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, print "Buzz." For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz."

## Exercise 4: Calculate Factorial
Write a JavaScript function to calculate the factorial of a number using a loop.

## Exercise 5: Guess the Number
Create a simple number guessing game. Generate a random number between 1 and 100 and have the user guess the number. Provide hints to help the user find the correct answer.

## Exercise 6: Display a Multiplication Table
Write a program that takes a number as input and displays the multiplication table for that number, from 1 to 10, using a loop.

## Exercise 7: Reverse a String
Write a JavaScript function that takes a string as input and returns the reverse of the string using a loop.

## Exercise 8: Check for Palindrome
Write a function that checks if a given word is a palindrome (a word, phrase, or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward). Ignore spaces and capitalization when checking.

## Exercise 9: Prime Number Checker
Write a JavaScript program that checks if a given number is prime (a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself) using loops and conditions.

These exercises focus on basic control structures and primitive data types, which should help your friend get more comfortable with conditions and loops in JavaScript. They don't require knowledge of arrays and objects. Your friend can copy these exercises into a markdown file and practice solving them. Happy coding!
